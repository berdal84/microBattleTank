# MicroBattleTank's lua scripts
This repository contains some MicroBattleTank's [ShiVaEngine](https://shiva-engine.com/) Scripts written in lua.

I'm in a cleaning process of my 10 years old source from by old ShiVaEngine video game project. So scripts will come here AIM* by AIM. By the way I'll not share the AIM since they are binary files.

The idea behind that is to show my ShiVaEngine programming skills.

*AIM: is and AIModel ([read](http://documentation.shiva3dengine.com/doc/) ShiVaEngine Doc)
